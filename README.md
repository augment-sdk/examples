# Augment SDK Examples

This directory contains examples and tutorials demonstrating how to use the Augment SDK for advanced AI memory management. These examples showcase various features of the SDK and provide practical use cases to help you get started quickly.

## 🚀 Getting Started

If you're new to Augment SDK, start with the `quickstart` directory:

- `basic_memory_operations.py`: Simple memory storage and retrieval operations
- `memory_layers_demo.py`: Working with different memory layers (ephemeral, working, semantic, etc.)
- `api_server_quickstart.py`: How to start and use the API server

## 📚 Directory Structure

- **quickstart/**: Basic examples to help you get started
- **memory_systems/**: Examples focused on memory management features
- **integrations/**: Examples showing how to integrate with other frameworks and tools
- **applications/**: Complete application examples using Augment SDK
- **advanced/**: Advanced usage and customization examples

## 🧠 Memory Systems

The `memory_systems/` directory contains examples demonstrating the core memory features:

- Hierarchical memory layers
- Recursive knowledge refinement
- Context-aware memory recall
- Meta-cognitive operations (self-reflection)
- Memory decay and rejuvenation

## 🔌 Integrations

The `integrations/` directory shows how to integrate Augment SDK with:

- Language models (OpenAI, HuggingFace)
- Vector databases (FAISS, PostgreSQL)
- Web frameworks (FastAPI, Flask)

## 💡 Example Applications

The `applications/` directory contains complete application examples:

- Research Assistant: An application that helps with research by managing and recalling information
- Conversational Agent: A conversational agent with enhanced memory capabilities
- Knowledge Base: A self-evolving knowledge base that refines information over time

## 🛠️ Advanced Examples

The `advanced/` directory contains examples for more advanced usage:

- Creating custom memory layers
- Domain-specific memory adaptation
- Distributed memory orchestration
- Performance optimization

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before running these examples, make sure you have:

1. Installed Augment SDK:
   ```bash
   pip install augment-sdk
   ```

2. Set up any required dependencies for specific examples (mentioned in each example file)

## 🎯 Running the Examples

Each example can be run directly using Python:

```bash
python examples/quickstart/basic_memory_operations.py
```
